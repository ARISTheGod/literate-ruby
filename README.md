# Literate Ruby Specification

This is an experiment in "literate specification".

As defined here, a "literate specification" is comprised of five parts:

1. The human readable text of the specification, which is suitable for documentation.
1. A special-purpose specification language with a defined logic that enables reasoning about the specification.
1. Example source code that illustrates the specification. Execution of the example code results in a state that shows compliance or noncompliance with the specification the source code illustrates.
1. A system that implements the specification and is architected such that all aspects of the specification are observable and controllable.
1. A system that processes the literate specification and causes the example source code to be run on the system that implements the specification.
